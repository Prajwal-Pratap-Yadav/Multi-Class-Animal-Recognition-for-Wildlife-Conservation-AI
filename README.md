# 🐾 Multi-Class Animal Recognition for Wildlife Conservation AI

A deep learning-based computer vision project designed to identify and classify wild animals from camera trap images. This system supports wildlife conservation by automating species recognition, minimizing manual effort, and enabling real-time biodiversity tracking.

## 🌍 Overview

Monitoring wildlife is crucial for ecological research, conservation planning, and anti-poaching initiatives. However, manual identification from camera trap footage is labor-intensive and prone to human error. This project harnesses the power of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to recognize various animal species in challenging, real-world environments with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🧠 **Intelligent Deep Learning**: Implements custom CNN or pre-trained architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) for effective multi-class classification.
- 📷 **High-Quality Dataset**: Trained on a diverse collection of wildlife images covering multiple species.
- 📊 **Robust Evaluation**: Tracks performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- 📈 **Training Insights**: Visualizes loss and accuracy in real time via TensorBoard or Matplotlib.
- 🌐 **Deployment Ready**: Easily adaptable for integration into mobile applications or conservation tools.
